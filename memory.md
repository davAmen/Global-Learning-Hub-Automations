## 2026-09-26, Reconcile through an isolated GitHub-based branch

**What was decided:** Use `reconcile/github-main`, based on the selected GitHub repository's fetched `main`, as the safe place to integrate reviewed work. Preserve the earlier local `main`; port changes selectively after review.
**Why:** The local and GitHub branches diverged and use different layouts. The GitHub branch contains newer platform/security documentation and root-level `src/`, while the local branch contains `backend/` and `frontend/`.
**What was rejected:** Force-pushing or merging the entire local tree over GitHub, which could discard remote-only work or introduce incompatible paths.
